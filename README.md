# PID_Box 



## PID_Box Planning
* make the box in solid works
* make the servo holder
* make holes for swtiches/ panel mount
* Lcd rectangular hole with hole skrews
* make the battery hole




## Problem/Solution


### Problem
The problem we have with our pid box is figuring ou the size because the size we have right now is to big and the acrlic size is to small in height and weidth so we have to figure out the right size so that problem does not occur.




### Solution
The solution to our problem is to make the walls smaller by changing the width and height then change the location of the battery pack to thee outside of the box instead of the inside.Because I believe it would be a big mess if the battery pack is in the way of the wires then it could mess up the wiring.



## Criteria and Constraints


### Criteria
* Finish the box and fix the width and height so that the walls will be able to fit in solid works drawing.
* Finish the git hub pid box page
* The photointerrupter should be able to read how fast the wheel is going then it will appear on the lcd how fast its going.
